What has been built?
This project is a Streamlit-based data chatbot that allows users to interact with a CSV dataset using natural language. It acts as a conversational interface for data analysis, enabling a user to upload a CSV file and then ask questions about the data as if they were talking to a data analyst. The app is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, providing real-time responses to queries.

How it works
The application's core functionality is built on a layered approach to query processing:

Data Ingestion: The user uploads a CSV file, which is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the data_handler.py script.

Chat Interface: The app.py file creates a conversational UI using Streamlit's built-in chat components. All messages are stored in st.session_state to maintain the chat history across user interactions.

Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the application follows a multi-step process to find the answer:

Cache Check: It first looks for an exact match in a session-based cache to provide an immediate response for repeated queries.

Semantic Search: If no exact match is found, it uses a simple vector database (vector_store.py) to search for a semantically similar query that has been answered before. This is a form of intelligent caching that saves time and LLM costs.

LLM Processing: If neither cache provides a match, the query is sent to the query_engine.py. This engine uses PandasAI to connect a large language model (LLM) to the pandas DataFrame. The LLM translates the natural language question into executable Python code that performs the required data analysis.

Dynamic Display: The app.py script then dynamically displays the result based on the data type returned by PandasAI. This is the key fix for the issues you were experiencing. The code now correctly renders pandas DataFrames as tables, Matplotlib figures as charts, and plain strings or numerical values as formatted text.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for building the interactive web application.

Data Handling: Pandas for all data manipulation and analysis.

Conversational AI: PandasAI is used to connect the LLM to the DataFrame, and an OpenAI LLM (or another configured LLM) handles the natural language understanding.

Semantic Caching: Sentence-Transformers for creating vector embeddings of queries and FAISS for fast similarity search.

Deployment: The application is designed to run on a Streamlit server, making it easy to deploy.
